Covid-19 live tracker for India: Karan Patel, Matthew Nyberg, John Ney, Niudun Wang

Project Description: We are making a live tracker for India as there are not many websites that do that. We found some good data on the internet and plan to use it to generate 3 possible types of graphs. Country graph : Indiaâ€™s line graph consisting of 3 lines: active cases, deceased cases, and recovered cases. State graph: This will have a list of buttons on the left side of the border pane. These buttons will be the names of the states, which on clicked will lead to a graph of that state similar to the line graph layout of the country graph. Lastly, we will have a bar graph representing the age group affected (deceased cases, active cases and recovered cases)
